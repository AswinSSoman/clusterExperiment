Changes in version 1.2.0-9001 ( Release date:   )
==============
Changes:
* plotHeatmap accepts data.frame values for the data argument (calls `data.matrix` on object and sends to matrix version)

Bug fixes:
* plotHeatmap now goes through the clusterLegend input and removes levels that do not exist in the sampleData; this was causing incorrect coloring when the clusterLegend had more (or less) levels that it assigned color to than the sampleData did (e.g. if sampleData was subset of larger dataset upon which the original colors were assigned.)

Changes in version 1.2.0 ( Release date:  2017-04-04 )
==============
Changes:
* RSEC now has option `rerunClusterMany`, which if FALSE will not rerun the clusterMany step if RSEC is called on an existing clusterExperiment object (assuming of course, clusterMany has been run already on the object)
* setBreaks now has option `makeSymmetric` to force symmetric breaks around zero when using the quantile option. 
* setBreaks now has a default for breaks (i.e. for minimal use, the user doesn't have to give the argument, just the data) in which case setBreaks will automatically find equal-spaced breaks of length 52 filling the range of data compatible with aheatmap. The order of the arguments `data` and `breaks` has been switched, however, to better accomodate this usage. 
* plotClusters can now handle NA values in the colData
* plotClusters for `clusterExperiment` object now allows for setting `sampleData=TRUE` to indicate the plotting all of the sampleData in the colData slot.
* nPCADims now allows values between 0,1 to allow for keeping *proportion* of variance explained.
* addClusters now allows for argument `clusterLabel` to assign a clusterLabel when the added cluster is a vector (if matrix, then clusterLabel is just the column names of the matrix of cluster assignments)

Bug fixes:
* fixed bug in clusterExperiment subsetting to deal with orderSamples correctly.
* fixed bug in mergeClusters unable to plot when too big of edge lengths (same as plotDendrogram)
* fixed bug in subsetting, where unable to subset samples by character
* fixed bug in removeClusters so that correctly updates dendro_index and primary_index slots after cluster removed.

Changes in version 1.1.1 (Release date: 2016-10-14 )
==============

Changes:
* Inverted definition of contrast for one-versus-all so now is X-ave(all but X); this means logFC positive -> cluster X greater than average of rest

Bug fixes:
* add check in clusterMany that non-zero dimensions
* changed 'warning' to 'note' in combineMany when no clusters specified.
* fixed bug in plotDendrogram unable to plot when makeDendrogram used dimReduce="mad"
* fixed bug in clusterMany where beta set to NA if clusteringFunction is type K. Added check that beta cannot be NA.
* Added check that alpha and beta in (0,1)

Changes in version 0.99.3 (Release date:  2016-07-26)
==============

Changes:
* plot in mergeClusters now uses cluster names and colors from clusterLegend
* plotDendrogram now calls plot.phylo
* add 'clusterLabel' argument to `clusterSingle`
* add options 'mad' and 'cv' to the dimensionality reduction. Also made option to only use clustered samples for feature reduction for relevant functions (e.g. `makeDendrogram`).
* clusterSingle now always returns the D matrix to the slot coClustering (previously only did so if D was from subsampling).
* change so that clusterSingle takes dissimilarity matrix, and now clusterMany calculates dissimilarities up front (rather than recalculating each time)
* add RSEC function for wrapper that leads to RSEC algorithm.
* add test for clusterMany to make sure replicable with past results (not unit test because too long to run, so not part of R build)

Bug fixes:
* fix bug in .TypeIntoIndices so that handles mix of clusterType and clusterLabels in whichClusters
* fixed bug in plotCoClustering so handles clusterSamplesData
* D for clusterD is now distance, not similarity, for 0-1, meaning larger values are values that are less similar.
* fix bug in plotClusters that would give clusterLegend entries that were vectors, not matrices.

Changes in version 0.99.1 (Release date: 2016-05-24 )
==============

Changes:
* changes to pass development version of bioConductor checks.

Changes in version 0.99.0 (Release date: 2016-05-24 )
==============

Changes:
* changed number to indicate bioconductor submission

Changes in version 0.2.0 (Release date: 2016-05-10 )
==============

Changes:

* Allow 'whichCluster'/'whichClusters' arguments to match to clusterLabels, not just clusterTypes
* Added slot 'dendro_index' 
* Added 'whichCluster' argument to `makeDendrogram`
* Added 'hierarchicalK' clustering
* Added default distance for 0-1 clustering
* Added ability to define distance for clustering
* Added 'setToCurrent' and 'setToFinal' options to update status of a cluster.
* Added unit tests for workflow function (in test_constructor)
* 'getBestFeatures' now calls 'clusterContrasts' internally
* Output for 'clusterContrasts' changed
* Removed 'Index' output for getBestFeatures
* Changed tests for getBestFeatures to run on standard objects (which means now have -2 values to test against)
* User can now give clusterLabel for resulting cluster of combineMany and mergeClusters


Changes in version 0.1.0 (Release date: 2016-05-04)
==============

Changes:

* Conversion to S4 language for bioConductor submission
* All previous functions have been overhauled, renamed, etc.

Changes in version 0.0.0.9006
==============

Changes:

* fixed so that mergeClusters, clusterHclust, and getBestFeatures will appropriately convert if the input of clustering vector is a factor rather than numeric (with warning).
* fixed mergeClusters to have option to indicate that input matrix is a count matrix (in which case will create dendrogram with log(counts+1) and will do getBestFeatures with the voom correction) 
* added more tutoral-oriented vignette (old vignette is now the documentation vignette with more detail about the internal workings of package). Currently is just simulated data, but will be updated to real single-cell sequencing dataset.

Changes in version 0.0.0.9005
==============

Changes:

* Changed simulated data so load all with data(simData) rather than separate calls for simData and simCount. Also added 'trueCluster' vector to give true cluster assignments of simulated data
* added dendro example to getBestFeatures
* added example to clusterHclust
* added single function for converting to phylobase tree (used internally by package)
* added functionality to find proportion of significant null hypotheses for merging clusters (mergeClusters)

Changes in version 0.0.0.9004
==============

Changes:

* Changed clusterMany.R to only set k<-NA if sequential=FALSE (previously for all where findBestK=TRUE)
* Added to vignette
* fixed bug in plotClusters to correctly plot "-1"
